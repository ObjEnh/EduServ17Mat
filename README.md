Programs and data for generation, checking and enhancement of land cover maps. 
These are additions to the book "Automated extraction of topographic map data from remotely sensed imagery by classification and cartographic enhancement".
The programs and data are stored in the directories "gen_LCM" (generation of land cover maps) and "enh_OBJ" (enhance object). Use eventually an updated version of the package 'buildenh' to enhance objects.
